# neural-networks-from-scratch
In this notebook, I implemented a neural network from scratch using only NumPy. It helped me gain an in-depth understanding of how neural networks operate, including the forward and backward passes.<br>I also used Pandas to load data, Matplotlib to plot results, and Tqdm for tracking training progress.<br>You can find the dataset used here: [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/oddrationale/mnist-in-csv)

## Features
 - Pure NumPy Implementation: No high-level frameworks; I coded the core mechanics myself.
 - Progress Tracking: Monitor training progress with Tqdm progress bars.
 - Visualization: Plot training results and metrics with Matplotlib.

## Usage
It is pretty straight-forward, just follow along the notebook.

This project was inspired by the insightful videos from [GreenCode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAkMcPfY_Ns&t=38s) and [Sentdex](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQVvvaa0QuDcjD5BAw2DxE6OF2tius3V3). Their tutorials greatly aided me in understanding the fundamentals of neural network implementation.
